Alongside software development and data engineering,
I've worked in analytics, marketing, machine learning and cloud computing.
I love solving problems and Iâ€™m flexible enough to help you.

I perform contract, consulting or freelance engagements that help you and challenge me.
My experience extends to leading teams, technical architecture and product development.
Whilst I'm primarily a hands-on software developer and data engineer I'm happy taking on broader roles.

Contact me to see how I can help at [paul@tempered.works](mailto:paul@tempered.works).
