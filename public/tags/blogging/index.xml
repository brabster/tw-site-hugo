The more recent article is original and talks about the experiences we&amp;rsquo;ve had putting together streaming demos of real-time streaming data processing solutions.

Why GatsbyJS? I think GatsbyJS is interesting when compared to other static site generators because it&amp;rsquo;s based on GraphQL and React.</description></item></channel></rss>
